The dark brown \"runner\" hyphae of the fungus may or may not be visible on the root surface. These hyphae are typically ectotrophic (growing on the outside of the roots), but the absence of runner hyphae is not a reliable diagnostic feature for the disease. This is because the fungus may penetrate the roots of young wheat plants and grow between the cortex and stele, often without being observed."

For comparative purposes, isolates were also collected from infected fruits of mango (Mangifera indica) and strawberry (Fragaria spp.) in a local market in Chiang Mai. The isolation of the fungus was carried out using two different methods, depending on whether fungal sporulation was visible. In cases without visible sporulation, the procedure outlined by Photita et al. (2005) was used. Tissue pieces (5 \u00d7 5 mm) were taken from the margins of infected fruit tissue, surface-sterilized in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 3\u20135 minutes, and rinsed in sterile water. These pieces were then placed on water agar (WA) plates and incubated at room temperature (28\u201330\u00b0C). Any hyphal mycelium that developed was transferred aseptically to potato dextrose agar (PDA). The fungi were identified based on their sporulation patterns, and single-spore isolation was done following the method of Choi et al. (1999), with some modifications. For fruits with visible sporulation, spore masses were streaked onto WA plates, and a single germinated spore was transferred onto PDA.

All strawberry plant parts are susceptible to infection, although fruit rot is particularly damaging in production fields, where yield losses can be severe. Anthracnose development in strawberry nurseries not only reduces daughter plant production but also has serious consequences for pathogen dissemination on contaminated transplants. Once C. acutatum is introduced into production fields, disease outbreaks can be very difficult to manage because available tactics are only partially effective. The use of pathogen-free propagation material, therefore, is highly desirable but is difficult to implement due to the lack of adequate detection and certification schemes for C. acutatum on symptomless plants."

The genus contains approximately 189 species organized into at least 11 major phylogenetic lineages, also known as species complexes. The Colletotrichum acutatum species complex is a diverse yet relatively closely related group of plant pathogenic fungi within this genus. Within the species complex we find a wide diversity of important traits such as host range and host preference, mode of reproduction, and differences in the strategy used to infect their hosts. Research on fungal comparative genomics have attempted to find correlations in these traits and patterns of gene family evolution, but such studies typically compare fungi from different genera or even different fungal Orders. The C. acutatum species complex contains most of this diversity within a group of relatively closely related species. This Perspective article presents a review of the current knowledge on C. acutatum phylogeny, biology, and pathology. It also demonstrates the suitability of C. acutatum for the study of gene family evolution on a fine scale to uncover evolutionary events in the genome that are associated with the evolution of phenotypic characters important for host interactions."

Researchers like Shear & Wood (1907, 1913) and Small (1926) concluded that many of the species described by host preference were, in fact, the same.

For example, Mackie et al. (2007) linked races 1, 2, and 4 of C. trifolii to quantitative trait loci (QTL) conferring resistance in lucerne.

Cutinase, an enzyme involved in the breakdown of cutin, is hypothesized to contribute to the pathogen\u2019s ability to infect plant hosts. To explore its role, the cutinase gene was silenced in C. truncatum using RNA interference (RNAi) technology. A recombinant plasmid expressing hairpin RNA targeting the cutinase gene was constructed and transformed into C. truncatum. The resulting transformants were analyzed for cutinase expression, growth, and pathogenicity on susceptible host plants. The findings suggest that silencing cutinase gene expression significantly affects the pathogenicity of C. truncatum, providing insights into the potential use of cutinase inhibitors for managing anthracnose diseases in crops."

The study showed no significant difference in infection efficiency when the fruit was wounded, indicating that cutinase may not be as important in the later stages of infection. This observation is consistent with previous research, which suggests that cutinase\u2019s primary function is limited to adhesion and penetration, rather than the subsequent progression of the infection."

Numerous studies have reported subgroups within the C. acutatum species complex. Multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3) of 331 strains previously identified as C. acutatum and other related taxa, including strains from numerous hosts with wide geographic distributions, confirmed the molecular groups previously recognized and identified a series of novel taxa. Thirty-one species are accepted, of which 21 have not previously been recognized. Colletotrichum orchidophilum clusters basal to the C. acutatum species complex. There is a high phenotypic diversity within this complex, and some of the species appear to have preferences for specific hosts or geographical regions. Others appear to be plurivorous and are present in multiple regions. In this study, only C. salicis and C. rhombiforme formed sexual morphs in culture, although sexual morphs have been described from other taxa (especially as laboratory crosses), and there is evidence of hybridization between different species. One species with similar morphology to C. acutatum but not belonging to this species complex was also described here as new, namely C. pseudoacutatum."

There is an ongoing effort to establish species concepts and formalize names currently in use. While morphology alone may not resolve many challenges in species delineation, a polyphasic approach is recommended for determining species boundaries, epitypifying existing names, and introducing new species.

This approach is especially crucial for Colletotrichum species due to their simple morphologies and the confusion in their current taxonomy. A successful DNA barcoding system for Colletotrichum depends on reliable sequences from type or verified strains and the selection of appropriate gene(s).

However, the applicability of various techniques for the overall delineation of subspecific subpopulations has yet to be fully determined. The ability to accurately identify phenotypically similar strains from diverse sources and to distinguish them from other phenotypes using molecular markers needs to be demonstrated.

The method is based on multi-locus-controlled self/nonself discrimination between fungal strains, providing clear-cut results in most cases. This makes VCG a useful tool for examining clonally related populations, allowing for the identification of subgroups within a species.

In sexually reproducing populations with a Glomerella stage, relationships can be determined based on sexual compatibility, which serves as the ultimate criterion for delineating mating populations within a species. This method differs from DNA-based techniques, as it involves living fungi and their interactions. Therefore, strains to be compared might need to be transported across geographical regions, which can pose a risk of unintended pathogen dissemination."

The potential for Colletotrichum species to act as entomopathogens may be unexpected; however, the scale insect is a sap-sucker, and C. fioriniae was found to be widespread as an endophyte, both in the host plant (Tsuga canadensis) of the insect and in a diverse set of associated plants.

This latent phase is marked by limited fungal development due to poor enzyme secretion. However, as the fruit ripens, the fungus can develop and cause anthracnose fruit rot. This phenomenon illustrates the ability of Colletotrichum species to remain dormant and cause disease once conditions become conducive to their growth."

Of the pathogens associated, by far the most common are species of the genus Colletotrichum. Members of this group are particularly adapted to this form of activity. Their capacity for maintaining a saprophytic existence on dying host parts ensures an effective source of inoculum. In addition, by forming latent infections throughout the growing period of the fruit, the parasite is rendered largely independent of environmental conditions at the time of ripening, not to mention the protection afforded from the action of fungicides."

The present paper is an attempt to place these species in their correct position and at the same time summarize their main characteristics. It is hoped that the information presented will assist future determinations and that the importance of individual diseases will be more clearly appreciated.\nTaxonomy within the genus Colletotrichum has long been in an unsatisfactory position, and many poorly defined species exist. Arx (1957a, 1957b) attempted the difficult task of clarifying the position. While this work has brought about a very useful simplification and drawn attention to the need for a drastic reduction in the number of species, it is inevitable that within the synonyms listed by Arx there will be species or groups of species which, on further investigation, will be shown to merit separate status. This has been borne out in the present work, where use has been made of a previously described variety to designate one such group."

In 2003, strawberries were planted across a total area of 7503 hectares in Korea, with 7172 hectares dedicated to plastic greenhouse cultivation. The total production for the fresh market amounted to 205,427 tonnes (Anonymous, 2004).

This disease, caused by the pathogen Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, has made these cultivars difficult to grow, particularly in Korea (Nam et al., 1998; Kim & Nam, 1999).

This relationship has been exploited for managing and reducing disease severity in various crops (Huber & Watson, 1974; Engelhard, 1989; Huber & McCay-Buis, 1993). Specifically, the type of nitrogen used in fertilization can significantly influence disease development. For example, the application of ammonium sulfate ((NH\u2084)\u2082SO\u2084) was found to suppress the black root rot complex (Rhizoctonia fragariae / Pratylenchus penetrans) in strawberries (Elmer & LaMondia, 1999), while ammonium nitrogen (NH\u2084-N) fertilizer controlled C. phomoides (Williams, 1965)."

However, C. hippeastri differs in several key characteristics. The conidia of C. hippeastri are typically narrower near the ends or at the center, whereas the conidia of C. dracaenophilum and C. nupharicola do not narrow (Johnson et al., 1997; Farr et al., 2006). Furthermore, germinating conidia of C. hippeastri form 2-4 cells, a trait distinct from other species. In comparison, C. nupharicola\u2019s conidia form 2-celled structures, and secondary conidia emerge from the germ tubes (Johnson et al., 1997). The appressoria of C. hippeastri are also larger than those of C. nupharicola (10.5-17.5 \u00d7 8-12.5 \u00b5m vs. 6-10 \u00d7 7-9 \u00b5m), and they are irregular, crenate, or lobed, whereas those of C. nupharicola are ovoid to clavate.

Unlike C. sansevieriae, which is highly host-specific to Sansevieria (Nakamura et al., 2006), C. hippeastri is not restricted to a specific host. C. hippeastri also grows faster than C. dracaenophilum, C. sansevieriae, and C. nupharicola, with additional colony characteristics that differentiate it from these species (Johnson et al., 1997; Farr et al., 2006; Nakamura et al., 2006).

Furthermore, inducing mycelial appressoria, particularly for cylindrical-spored species, often took more than 10 days (Cannon et al., 2008; Crouch et al., 2009b). This makes conidial appressoria easier to characterize, a point emphasized by Cai et al. (2009)."

The results revealed that C. cliviae, C. hippeastri, and C. hymenocallidis are not host-specific, as they were able to infect two or three different hosts (Table 6). The virulence potential of Colletotrichum species depends on several factors, such as plant varieties, humidity, temperature, and inoculum concentration (Simmonds, 1965; Freeman et al., 1998). Therefore, the pathogenicity and virulence of these new species should also be tested in vivo to gain a better understanding of their potential impact."

The average growth rates were as follows: C. asianum had a rate ranging from 0.38 to 1.59 cm/day, C. siamense ranged from 0.52 to 1.51 cm/day, and C. fructicola ranged from 0.60 to 1.19 cm/day. The conidia were all hyaline, aseptate, and ranged from long elliptic to cylindrical in shape. The length of the conidia for each isolate varied between 6.99 \u03bcm and 29.22 \u03bcm, while the width ranged from 2.99 \u03bcm to 9.85 \u03bcm (Supplementary Table S3).

At Bafou, all the semi-variograms were Gaussian (Fig. 5A to C). These curves suggested that the spread of CBD was more gradual and stepwise at Santa, whereas at Bafou, the disease could spread more rapidly to trees further away."

These species were reported for the first time in Brazil. To identify these species, multiple genetic markers were utilized, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), actin, \u03b2-tubulin, calmodulin, glutamine synthetase (GS), and the ITS region. Interestingly, a pathogenicity test conducted by Lima et al. (2015) revealed that C. karstii was unable to infect two mango cultivars, Keith and Palmer. This suggests that there may be preferences among Colletotrichum species for certain mango cultivars. However, no host specificity was observed when a cross-pathogenicity test was conducted on papaya, banana, guava, and bell pepper, implying that these Colletotrichum species have a broad host range."

For example, D0\u2032 increases from about 1.2 mm with 2 mm/h of (idealized) natural rain to about 2.5 mm with 60 mm/h of rain. The corresponding increase in rain intensity also leads to a higher frequency of drops of any given diameter. Drop size distribution is affected by the type of rain episode in addition to rain intensity. For instance, thunderstorms generally have larger D0\u2032 (or D0) than showers or oceanographic rains. Therefore, two rains of similar intensities but different types may vary considerably in kinetic energy, and more than just intensity may be required to assess the risk of dispersal events."

Other research using single-sized drops found that splash dispersal of spores increased with the size of drops, and hence, their velocity and kinetic energy. In our study, Rs increased with increasing D0\u2032, except for the 20W/69 kPa treatment.

Thus, the largest drops contribute most of the total kinetic energy in a rain episode. Slight changes in frequencies of large drops can have a major effect on the total kinetic energy per unit of area and time.

However, confounding variables in these systems have prevented any demonstration of a clear causal relationship between density and disease.

Plots established in 1991 for use in the 1992 experiment were all initially planted at a 30-cm spacing between plants, resulting in seven plants per row. The densities were altered through thinning and adding new transplants to adjust plant numbers:\nLowest density: Every other plant was removed (second, fourth, and sixth plants) from each row on 12 May 1992, and runners were removed as they rooted, maintaining a 60-cm spacing between plants.\nSecond density: The original 30-cm spacing was maintained, and runners were not allowed to establish new crowns.\nThird density: New crowns were planted between each existing plant on 8 May, and runners were allowed to root during the season.\nHighest density: Two new crowns were planted between existing plants on 8 May, with a transplanted runner from thinnings in low-density plots added on 21 May, ensuring no damage to previous transplants. Runners were also allowed to establish new crowns in this treatment.\nAt the beginning of the experiment, the resulting plant densities were approximately 1.7, 3.3, 6.7, and 14.3 plants per meter of row."

Specifically, the near side (closer to the inoculum source) consistently showed higher disease incidence than the far row side. Additionally, plant density had a nonlinear impact on disease incidence, as higher plant densities tended to reduce the mean disease incidence, though this relationship was not always straightforward."

(35) and were similar to those previously outlined. The pedicels of the fruit were held in place while the fruit was sprayed with the atomizer. After inoculation, the plants were placed in a controlled environmental chamber (Rheem Manufacturing Company, Asheville, NC) and misted for 24 hours with a Hermidifier mister (Hermidifier Co., Lancaster, PA). Subsequently, the plants were transferred to another chamber set to one of the following temperatures: 15\u00b0C, 20\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, or 30\u00b0C. The lighting was set to 190 \u00b5E s\u20131 m\u20132 for 14 hours daily, and relative humidity (RH) in the chamber averaged 40\u201360%. Five fruit were sampled starting from the appearance of lesions, and sporulation was assessed as described earlier. Sporulation assessment continued for 2 to 28 days, depending on the temperature. Not all four temperatures were evaluated for every isolate due to limitations in plant production within the greenhouse, and the number of incubation times varied. Each test was repeated one to three times.\nEach chunk now addresses a distinct part of the experiment, with clear labels for easy navigation and understanding."

Although the main data collection used detached fruit, similar results were obtained using infected fruit still attached to plants (Table 5). The conidia production on attached fruit was well predicted by equations developed from the detached fruit experiments, using four isolates, limited temperatures, and incubation times. Despite wide prediction intervals due to variation in detached fruit data, the overall closeness between predicted and observed sporulation was high. The mean difference in predicted versus observed log values was \u20130.037 (standard error = 0.057), indicating a slight overprediction. This difference in log units corresponds to a median observed-to-predicted spore ratio of 0.92, suggesting that predictions were slightly higher than actual observed values.

It causes fruit rot and flower blight in fruiting fields, and lesions on stolons, petioles, and leaves are particularly damaging in plant nurseries. In some regions, it can lead to crown rot and plant death. The pathogen is typically introduced to fields through infected or infested propagation material. During warm, moist periods, lesions on transplants produce abundant conidia that are dispersed by splashing water onto flowers and fruits, leading to new infections. However, in fields where symptomless propagation material is planted, the origin of the initial inoculum is not always clear.\nSeveral studies suggest that C. acutatum may develop quiescent infections on strawberry plants, but the role of these infections before fruit colonization and leaf senescence has not been fully explored. Symptomless foliage may harbor inoculum for fruit and flower infections from various Colletotrichum species. It has also been proposed that quiescent infections on strawberry leaves could contribute to strawberry anthracnose epidemics. Understanding the ecology of C. acutatum on strawberry foliage before fruit rot symptoms develop may help improve the management of strawberry anthracnose."

Conidial size and shape, along with conidial appressoria, were considered uninformative and of little use for species diagnosis in grass-associated Colletotrichum species. Species with similar morphological characteristics may exhibit considerable variation at the physiological and pathogenic levels. Recognition of this is particularly important for biosecurity, plant breeding, and integrated disease management. Taxonomy based on morphology alone is likely to result in ambiguity.

Through multigene phylogenetic analyses, 11 Colletotrichum species were identified, including three novel species. The prevalence of these species was determined through surveys in Thailand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, and Malaysia. Colletotrichum truncatum was found to be the most prevalent species, while other species like C. scovillei, C. siamense, and C. tropicale were also commonly identified. The pathogenicity of these species was tested on chili fruit, with results showing significant variation in lesion sizes, particularly between species in wounded and non-wounded fruit.

To ensure genetic consistency, each family had 57 seedlings propagated through runners, and four genetically identical plants were produced per seedling.

This version has several new features, including options for adding unaligned sequences into an existing alignment, adjustment of direction in nucleotide alignment, constrained alignment, and parallel processing, which were implemented after the previous major update. This report shows actual examples to explain how these features work, alone and in combination. Some examples incorrectly aligned by MAFFT are also shown to clarify its limitations.

Because of its high performance, MAFFT has become popular in recent years. After reviewing the previous version (version 6), we have been continuously improving its accuracy, speed, and utility in practical situations. These improvements and techniques were mostly reported in individual papers. In this report, we demonstrate the different kinds of analyses that can be achieved with the new features, alone and in combination, using realistic examples. We also discuss limitations of the current version by giving examples of sequences incorrectly aligned by MAFFT and describe our ongoing efforts to overcome these limitations."

According to a recent comparative study, there are two significantly different classes of MSA methods: similarity-based methods and evolution-based methods. MAFFT is classified as a similarity-based method. However, evolutionary information is useful even for similarity-based methods, because the sequences to be aligned are generated from a common ancestor in the course of evolution. In this respect, MAFFT takes evolutionary information into account."

It has since become an economically important problem in greenhouse tomato production throughout Europe, North America, Japan, and Israel (Jarvis, 1988).

Symptoms include dark brown necrotic lesions that form on the roots and crown region and may extend up the hypocotyl, stem, and foliage. This leads to localized discoloration of the vascular tissues, followed by leaf chlorosis, wilting, and death. The pathogen is spread via infected transplants, which often carry latent infections, and can grow through soil to infect adjacent plants. Airborne conidia dispersed by wind and fungus gnats [Bradysia sp. (Diptera: Sciaridae)] further increase the threat to tomato production."

Several species of Colletotrichum, such as C. fragariae, C. dematium, C. gloeosporioides, and C. acutatum, are associated with the disease. Anthracnose symptoms affect multiple plant parts including fruit, buds, blossoms, petioles, runners, crowns, and foliage. The two most destructive forms of the disease are crown rot anthracnose, typically caused by C. fragariae and primarily affecting roots, crowns, and fruit, and flower blight and fruit rot, caused by C. acutatum. The latter form, flower blight and fruit rot, is considered the main limiting factor for strawberry production in Brazil."

In Japan and elsewhere, strawberry anthracnose has been attributed to infections by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, causing at least one major epidemic of anthracnose crown rot in the United States during the 1970s (Smith 2008; Suzuki et al. 2010). Anthracnose disease is a significant problem in the Japanese strawberry cultivation industry, where infections are thought to spread primarily through latently infected plants and infected plant material (Suzuki et al. 2010). The presence of even one infected plant can lead to the infection of an entire field, highlighting the importance of early detection and classification."

The closely related species C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides produce a reddish-brown necrosis of crown tissue following infection that causes plants to wilt and collapse. Under greenhouse conditions or in summer nurseries, C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides also may produce necroses on stolons, lesions on fruit, or black leaf spots. Crown rot is a serious disease in subtropical strawberry production regions, such as those in the southeastern United States, since infection by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides is favored by warm, moist conditions. Although crown rot is observed in fields during the winter production season, it is most severe in summer nurseries in the southeast and is one of the primary reasons that transplants are produced in temperate regions."

These forms are interconnected as components of the nitrogen cycle. Ammonia (NH3) is naturally present in surface water and wastewater; however, its concentration is generally low in groundwater. This is because ammonia is adsorbed by soil particles and clay, making it less likely to leach from soils into groundwater. Nitrate (NO3-N), however, is a major environmental and public health concern when found in groundwater. Nitrates, once consumed, can be converted to nitrites in the intestines. When absorbed into the bloodstream, nitrites prevent hemoglobin from transporting oxygen, which can be particularly harmful to infants, leading to conditions like methemoglobinemia.

Other species such as C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides are more frequently associated with petiole and stolon lesions, as well as crown rot. Despite their differences in symptoms and affected plant parts, these three Colletotrichum species may cause similar symptoms and sometimes appear on the same plant. These pathogens have spread globally, likely due to international plant exchanges, and their genetic diversity and geographical origins do not exhibit strong relationships. It is suggested that C. acutatum may have evolved into a more virulent subgroup that is highly host-specific to strawberries."

        "content": "Anthracnose Disease Symptoms\nAnthracnose disease manifests through several key symptoms. The initial sign of crown rot infection, often caused by C. fragariae or C. gloeosporioides, is the wilting of the youngest leaves. These wilted leaves may temporarily recover during the night but will ultimately wither and die within a few days. A red discoloration in the crown tissue follows, and the pathogen can often be isolated from this affected area. While C. acutatum can also cause crown death, it usually infects only one side of the crown, resulting in stunted plants rather than total death. The disease also causes petiole and stolon lesions that appear dark brown or black, sunken, and can girdle these plant structures. Pink spore masses are often seen near the center of these lesions. All three Colletotrichum species can also cause black leaf spots, particularly on the upper surface of strawberry leaves. C. acutatum tends to cause irregular leaf spots with necrotic black lesions at the tips, while C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides produce less necrotic spots. Root lesions and flower blights are also common, with fully open flowers being particularly susceptible. Infected fruits can become hard, brown, mummified, or have firm, sunken lesions with pink spore masses when ripe."

The length of this period depends on temperature, ranging from 2\u20133 days at 25\u00b0C to 6\u201317 days at 5\u00b0C. C. acutatum produces appressoria and secondary conidia on symptomless foliage, which can act as a significant inoculum source for fruit infections throughout the growing season. Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation require extended periods of wetness beyond the minimum 4 hours needed for secondary conidia formation. C. acutatum can survive in various environments for different lengths of time: up to 8 weeks on leaves, 5 weeks on fabric, and 12 months in soil and plant debris under dry conditions. However, conidia and sclerotia quickly die in moist conditions. Rain splash is the main method of dispersal, spreading conidia between plants, with most fruit infections occurring within a 25-cm radius of the initial inoculum source, usually an infected fruit."

The fungi penetrate the plant cuticle via an appressorium, and their hyphae grow within the epidermal and subepidermal cells, extending into the cell walls of the surrounding tissue. This phase is biotrophic, with the fungi living off the host cells without causing immediate cell death. After a short biotrophic phase, the fungi transition into a necrotrophic phase, where they proliferate among dead cells. The fungi\u2019s acervuli, which are reproductive structures, erupt through the cuticle, releasing conidia. While invasion of vascular tissue occurs, it remains minimal even after acervuli maturity.
